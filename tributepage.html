    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Capt. Vikram Batra life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1974</strong> - Born in Palampur,  Himachal Pradesh</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1996</strong> -  Joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1997</strong> - Graduated and was commissioned as a lieutenant into the Indian Army
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1998</strong> - He trained at areas that had significant militant activity including Sopore in Baramulla district, Jammu, and Kashmir, and Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. After completing the training, he was awarded alpha grading and rejoined his battalion in Jammu and Kashmir. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1999</strong> - He trained for Commando Course at Belgaum, Karnataka where he was awarded the highest grading Instructor's Grade. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1999</strong> - On June 13, the 2nd battalion, Rajputana Rifles (2 RAJ RIF) successfully recaptured Tololing mountain. Following the victory, the then commanding officer, Lt. Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi, ordered B Coy to attack Point 5140 under the command of Lt. Sanjeev Singh Jamwal, and D Coy, under the command of Lt. Vikram Batra, from two both east and south sides. At the Hump Complex, Jamwal and Batra were given the orders directly by Joshi. As their signals, Jamwal chose 'Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!' while Batra chose 'Yeh Dil Mange More!'. And 'SherShah' was Vikram’s code name
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1999</strong> - On the night of July 7, Capt. Vikram Batra and his men began their tortuous climb to fortify the Indian force which was already fighting the invaders at 16,000 feet. The enemy got wind that the formidable Sher Shah (Vikram’s code name) had arrived and and intensified their attack, raining mortar and automatic fire from above. They knew who Sher Shah was — by then, the young captain’s military prowess had become the stuff of legend on both sides.
